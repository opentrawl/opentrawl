# Vision

The project is called OpenTrawl: a trawl net drags the deep and brings
everything up, and the open prefix names the open-source, plugin-first
ambition. GitHub org `opentrawl`, one monorepo, one CLI (`trawl`), one
Mac app shipped as Trawl.

## North star

An entire history of you, agent searchable. An agent onboards into a
person's life with minimal steering: it can work out who the people in
your life are, how you talk to them and where, what you did, and what is
going on right now, by querying local archives of the services you
actually use.

Long-horizon tests, all of the same shape — inferences an agent should
make from the archives without being told:

- who someone's girlfriend is, and how they message her across
  Telegram, WhatsApp and Gmail, what events they share in Calendar,
  what notes they share, how many group chats they have in Signal
- who the family, close friends and colleagues are, and which channel
  each relationship lives on
- what the person does for work, what projects are active, and what
  changed this month
- where they lived and travelled, what they bought, what appointments
  recur, which social groups meet and how often

None of these are features to build one by one. They fall out of clean,
complete, queryable archives plus a capable agent. Get the data out;
the inferences follow.

## What the suite is

A local-first crawler suite for macOS: one app and one CLI that let you
authorise your services and crawl them into local, per-source SQLite
archives that agents can query through a single entry point.

The layers, bottom to top:

1. Source apps: iMessage, Telegram, WhatsApp, Gmail, Calendar, Contacts,
   Photos, X and Apple Notes today, with Signal and others later.
2. Source crawlers: one Go package per source, registered behind
   `trawl`. Each owns extraction, its own archive database, auth and
   session handling, search, status and privacy policy. Each conforms
   to the shared control contract.
3. Control contract: a trawlkit-defined JSON contract every crawler
   speaks: `metadata`, `status`, `sync`, `search`, `open`, `doctor` and
   `contacts export`, all with `--json`, all bounded, all human readable.
4. Federation surface: one CLI (`trawl`) that runs registered
   crawlers through the contract and gives agents and humans a single
   surface: status across everything, sync anything, search across
   sources. One Mac app that shows the key per-crawler metrics and
   handles authorisation. No knobs.
5. Derived layers: daily deltas, cross-source identity joins,
   clustering and per-thing cards, life orientation. Photos is the
   proving ground for a card built from deterministic source facts and
   model prose. That pipeline is not a template for other sources until
   one complete, inspectable card passes its input, output, restart and
   provenance gates. Derived layers build on the substrate; they never
   reach around it into source databases. The clustering and card
   mechanics already proven on maintainer data (clawsweeper, gitcrawl,
   discrawl) are useful prior art, not a contract for every surface.

## Design principles

- Agent first, human readable. Every output must make sense to a human
  reading it cold; if a human can read it properly, an agent can too.
  This goes down to the field level: every field, name and value must
  semantically make sense — real timestamps, human names, properly
  named keys. No machine row IDs, no raw epoch timestamps, no unbounded
  dumps.
- Local first, privacy by design. Archives, caches, source access and
  user control stay on your machine. Local first does not mean local
  models are preferred. A feature may send an explicit, bounded input
  to its configured frontier model service when the user invokes that
  feature. Photos image classification and its image-model evals use
  Ollama Cloud; they do not call paid model APIs directly. Model access
  goes through one provider seam, not a new integration surface per
  model.
- Federated, not unified. Each source keeps its own source-native
  database. The single entry point is a query surface, not a shared
  schema. Cross-source joins happen in derived layers, later, on top of
  proven per-source archives.
- Contract first. Every crawler implements one control contract, so the
  CLI and the app couple to that single interface, not to any crawler's
  internals. Adding a source today means writing a Go crawler that
  implements the contract and registering it in `trawl`, then
  recompiling. A published, any-language plugin path is a later goal,
  not the current build.
- No knobs. One and only one obvious way of doing things. Defaults over
  configuration. A settings surface is a design failure until proven
  otherwise.
- Secrets never in output. Auth state is reported as booleans and expiry
  dates. No command prints tokens, cookies or key material.
- Bounded output everywhere. Every command paginates or truncates with an
  explicit indicator. Token budgets are a design axis, not an
  afterthought.
- Read only in v1. Write capability (sending messages) comes later
  through source-specific access CLIs, behind explicit authorisation.

## Engineering principles

- Software fixes what it can fix. A printed remedy is an admission,
  reserved for fixes that need the world to change (permissions,
  auth, a costly sync). Derived state self-heals at the point of use;
  diagnostics whose remedy is safe, idempotent and local are design
  bugs. Scope warning (ratified 2026-07-03): point-of-use self-healing
  applies to cheap derived state only — caches, indexes, lookups.
  Model-generated artifacts snapshot their full input at generation
  time and stay internally coherent; when their inputs change, they
  propagate through the classification queue as batched, incremental
  regeneration of the affected subset — never recomputed at read time,
  never split across two moments.

The bar for every line of code and every surface in this repo:

- As simple as possible, but no simpler. KISS, YAGNI, less is more.
  Prefer deleting a concept to documenting it.
- One and only one obvious way to do each thing, with as few knobs as
  possible. No modes, no fallbacks, no compatibility shims without
  current evidence.
- Human readable with no magic. Code must be self-explanatory: no magic
  constants, one obvious job per function, boundaries in the Ousterhout
  sense (deep modules, simple interfaces). If a reader needs a comment
  to follow the code, rewrite the code.
- Files under about 400 lines. Split when they grow.
- The tree tells the story. Running `tree` should reveal what the repo
  is and how it is organised — for humans and for agents. Structure is
  documentation.
- CLIs follow [clig.dev](https://clig.dev). Curated, minimal,
  consistent surfaces; taste is a requirement, not a polish step.
- Go for crawlers and the CLI. Swift and SwiftUI for the Mac app.
- Trunk-based development. Small logical commits on main. Speed over
  ceremony.
- Facts and gates are deterministic; interpretation belongs to the
  model. Code computes, stores and gate-checks mechanical truth (time,
  GPS, geometry, thresholds); models own all reading of meaning,
  phrasing and confidence of claims. Code never inspects model prose
  to judge or route it — cognitive decisions are asked of the model
  as structured answers and gated mechanically.
- Deterministic checks are tripwires, not gates. Regex/contract
  checks only remember previously discovered defects. The gate for
  any output-shape change is an adversarial review by a model that
  did not author the change, over raw transcripts of every affected
  permutation, judged against the blind-person bar (a reader who
  cannot see the source understands every field, and nothing is
  missing they would still have to ask about).
- Test against real inputs and outputs. Agents and tests must exercise
  raw, unmodified, untruncated real data flows — never faked,
  abbreviated or hand-massaged fixtures for the paths that matter. This
  is the only way to prove the thing actually works and to catch quiet
  degradation.
- Agents run unimpeded. The full dev loop — build, run, test, crawl,
  verify — works end to end with zero humans in the loop. One-time
  human setup (a permission grant, a signing certificate) is
  acceptable exactly once per machine; anything that recurringly needs
  a human is a design failure. If an agent hits a wall a human must
  clear, the wall is the bug.
- Declarative, minimal install surface. The dev loop needs no install
  step at all: one devenv at the monorepo root, crawlers run from
  source, and a repo-local bin directory on the shell's PATH is where
  `trawl` discovers dev binaries — clone, `devenv shell`, everything
  works. For consumers the Mac app is the main method and the only
  global install; a Homebrew tap and a Nix flake cover CLI users. No
  ad-hoc global installs, and no `trawl install` package manager. State
  and config live under one root with per-crawler subdirectories, not
  scattered dotfiles, via a shared trawlkit config option.
- Observability for free. Structured logs, run history and doctor
  diagnostics come from trawlkit once, in one consistent, greppable,
  agent-first shape — a crawler gets debuggability by using the
  substrate, not by designing its own logging. Nothing leaves the
  machine.

## Now, next, later

- Now: iMessage, Telegram, WhatsApp, Gmail, Calendar, Contacts, Photos,
  X and Apple Notes, behind the federation CLI, with the new Mac app.
- Next: Signal (research spike first), daily deltas ("what changed in
  the last 24 hours"), write capability, and a published plugin API with
  agent surfaces (MCP or an Executor source) as thin adapters over the
  contract.
- Horizon: cross-source inference: identity resolution, relationship
  inference, life orientation reports. This is where clustering and
  per-thing cards come in — the clawsweeper/gitcrawl pattern applied to
  people, threads and events instead of issues and PRs. The suite's job
  is to make this possible by shipping clean archives and contact
  exports; the inference layer stays out of the crawlers.

## Prior art and how we use it

- trawlkit: the substrate. Shared SQLite, snapshot, sync-state, vector
  and control mechanics. It is monorepo-native and carries the shared
  contract work.
- crawlbar: proved the control-plane idea and wrote down the control
  protocol and a quality rubric worth keeping. Its settings-driven
  implementation is what the new Mac app replaces.
- imsg, wacli, gogcli, remindctl: per-service access CLIs with read and
  write verbs. Too specific to be the entry point, exactly right as
  adapters under crawlers and as the later write path.
- Executor (executor.sh, MIT): an MCP gateway that normalises every tool
  to name plus input and output schemas, with host-side credential
  resolution and aggressive token economy. Validates our contract-first
  design and our secrets rule. Difference: Executor is a gateway service;
  we are local-first CLIs, so it is a v2 integration target, not a
  dependency.

### Clustering and cards: the clawsweeper pattern

The earlier maintainer-data system already runs the exact inference
pattern our horizon needs. It splits across three repos, and each half
is reusable:

- gitcrawl is the clustering engine. Every issue and PR gets an
  embedding; edges combine cosine similarity with deterministic
  reference links (explicit cross-references), because links catch what
  embeddings miss; bounded union-find turns edges into clusters. The
  governance layer is the real prize: clusters have stable
  content-hashed identities, memberships move through a state machine
  (active, excluded, removed), and human curation verbs (exclude,
  include, set-canonical, merge, split, close) are stored as overrides
  that survive every recomputation. Re-running the maths never destroys
  human judgement.
- clawsweeper is the per-thing card and judge. Each reviewed item gets
  one durable card: a markdown record plus a typed JSON verdict
  (decision, confidence, evidence with file and line references, risks,
  suggested action) and one edit-in-place comment. An LLM judges over
  hydrated context but is proposal-only; a deterministic apply step
  re-checks live state before any mutation. It does not cluster itself
  — it reads gitcrawl's SQLite snapshot by convention, proving the
  crawl layer and the reasoning layer can stay decoupled through a
  portable store.
- discrawl supplies the archive-side primitives: per-message
  embeddings, semantic and hybrid search, statistical roll-up reports,
  and structured entity extraction over people (member profiles).

Our horizon layer is this pattern generalised: gitcrawl's clustering
and durable governance applied to people, threads and events instead
of issues and PRs; clawsweeper-style typed cards and a proposal-only
judge on top; per-source crawler archives underneath, exchanged
through the same portable-SQLite seam. This one-shot orientation over
a corpus — cluster it, card it, review it — is the same move as
onboarding an agent into a life.

One caution: what works for clawsweeper's units (one issue, one PR,
one verdict) will not automatically fit other surfaces — a person or a
relationship is not a pull request. Each surface's unit of clustering
and carding gets evaluated and tested on real archives before we adopt
it. Photos card quality needs a frontier hosted vision model. Image
classification and classification evals run through Ollama Cloud,
behind the single provider seam. A small historical run favoured a
Gemini-class model, but it predates the current input-integrity and
representative-sampling gates and does not choose the production model.
Local models are not the preferred product path.

## Non-goals for v1

- no writes to any source
- no cloud sync or hosted service
- no cross-source joins or identity resolution inside crawlers
- no MCP server or gateway (the contract must make these trivial later)
- no prompt-tuned "intelligence" layered on thin archives; get the data
  out first
