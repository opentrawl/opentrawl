# TCC strategy

Decision record for how OpenTrawl handles macOS privacy permissions
(TCC). Decided early because attribution rules shape the process
architecture.

## Facts that decide it

- One permission covers almost everything in v1. iMessage, Apple
  Notes, Photos (direct sqlite), WhatsApp and Telegram desktop stores
  are all readable with Full Disk Access alone.
- Apple Calendar is the one outlier: EventKit needs its own
  interactive consent, FDA does not grant the API, and modern macOS
  has no readable on-disk calendar store. The v1 route around it:
  calcrawl reads iCloud calendars over CalDAV with an app-specific
  password — headless, no TCC involved, same source of truth. A
  native EventKit path (consent flow in the app) can come later for
  calendars that never touch iCloud.
- FDA and the App Sandbox do not compose. The app ships unsandboxed,
  Developer ID signed, notarized, outside the Mac App Store.
- TCC attributes terminal-spawned binaries to the terminal app, not
  the binary. Granting FDA to a Go binary does nothing; the terminal
  (or the app that spawned it) holds the grant.
- Signature-keyed grants die when the signature changes, and every Go
  rebuild re-signs ad hoc. Path-keyed grants and responsible-process
  inheritance survive rebuilds. Ad-hoc-signed app builds lose their
  grant on every rebuild — the app must always be signed with a stable
  identity, including dev builds.
- LaunchAgents are the least reliable TCC holders (attribution-chain
  failures). Scheduling stays inside the app's process tree: login
  item plus timer, never a LaunchAgent.
- There is no API to check FDA. The probe is a canary read of a
  protected path.

## The decision

Trawl.app holds Full Disk Access; crawlers run as its direct children
and inherit the grant. Developers and agents grant FDA to their
terminal once — the standard pattern for every tool in this space —
and everything then works from a shell too.

What this requires:

1. Stable signing from day one: a persistent self-signed certificate
   for dev builds, Developer ID plus notarization for releases. Never
   ad hoc.
2. Syncs are scheduled by the app from its own process tree (login
   item + timer), so crawler children always have an FDA ancestor.
3. `doctor` in every crawler and in `trawl` detects the permission
   failure by canary read and prints the exact remedy: grant FDA to
   Trawl (app users) or to your terminal (CLI users), with the System
   Settings deep link (`Privacy_AllFiles` pane).
4. App-side grant UX uses permiso's guided drag-into-Settings flow;
   it needs a one-line upstream addition for the FDA panel.

## Open risk, to spike before the app hardens

Inheritance normally flows to direct children, but there is a
documented case of macOS auto-denying a separately-signed child at a
different path. Spike (30 minutes): grant FDA to a stably-signed app
build, spawn a Go crawler, read a protected store. If inheritance
fails, the fallback is to embed crawler binaries inside the app bundle
under the app's signature — decide after the spike, not before.

## Rejected

- Path-based FDA grants per crawler binary: miserable consumer UX,
  breaks on package-manager upgrades, N binaries means N grants.
  Escape hatch only.
- FDA-holding helper daemon with the CLI over RPC: no shipping product
  in this space does it, launchd attribution is the least reliable,
  and it contradicts crawlers owning their own reads.
