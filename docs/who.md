# Who: people as a first-class query dimension

Design for the ship-blocking gap, grounded in mined evidence: a sweep
of months of real agent sessions (the moments the owner got angry, and
the questions actually asked) found that agents repeatedly fail on
people. They run "getting to know you" interviews instead of reading
archives that already hold the answer; they state stale personal facts
with confidence; and in several sessions the agent itself names
"resolve handles into people" as the unbuilt gap. Real requests are
imperative — "check my emails for the specs", "we already discussed
this, go find it" — and the retrieval verb constantly runs through a
person or a vendor.

Today no surface serves that. Search shows who said things but cannot
filter on it, and full-text-matching a person's name finds messages
that *mention* them, not conversations *with* them — the ones that
matter almost never contain the name.

## The shape

Two additions, one dependency, in strict order.

1. **Resolve first.** `trawl who <fuzzy>` turns a human fragment into
   a person: `trawl who mo` returns ranked candidates — display name,
   the sources they appear in, message volume — so humans and agents
   orient before filtering. Matching is prefix and substring over
   names, aliases and identifiers (clawdex's self-healing FTS index is
   exactly this; the command is a thin view over it). Ranked by
   message volume: the people you actually talk to come first.

2. **Then filter.** `search --who <person>` on every crawler that
   exports contacts, and federated on `trawl search`. The crawler
   filters at the archive (trawl-level post-filtering would silently
   lose recall behind per-crawler limits). Contract v1.1 addition,
   declared as a capability.

3. **The dependency: identity join lands first.** `--who alice` is
   dead on arrival while iMessage rows say `+15550100123`. Order:
   imsgcrawl resolves numbers to names via the Contacts store at sync;
   every crawler's contact export feeds clawdex; clawdex owns the
   cross-source identity graph. Then the flag works everywhere on day
   one.

## Method: stub before build

Before any implementation, a stubbed `trawl` (canned `who` results,
fake `--who` filtering) goes in front of cold agents with tasks taken
from the mined corpus of real requests — vendor-charge hunts ("find
the subscription that keeps charging me"), spec retrieval ("check my
mail for the bike specs"), decision recall ("we already discussed
this, go find it"), and person-scoped history. What agents type before
reading help is the API we should have built. The observed grammar
decides the final surface; this document records the starting
hypothesis, not the answer.

Open questions the stub must answer:
- Do agents reach for `--who alice` or `search alice: boat` or
  `search with:alice boat`? (Gmail taught the world `from:`-style
  operators; they may be the more discoverable grammar.)
- Does anyone use `trawl who` unprompted, or must search errors and
  help teach it?
- Is ranking by message volume the right orientation, or do agents
  want per-source identifiers echoed back for exact re-use?

## Non-goals

No fuzzy matching inside `--who` itself: resolve fuzziness in `who`,
filter with the exact resolved person. One obvious way; no similarity
knobs.
