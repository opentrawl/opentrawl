# Docs

The design of OpenTrawl, one file per topic. Start with the vision,
then the contract — everything else hangs off those two.

## Start here

- [vision.md](vision.md) — what OpenTrawl is and why it exists.
- [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) — the plan: phases, what is built, what is next.

## The contract and its surfaces

- [contract.md](contract.md) — the control contract every crawler speaks.
- [cli.md](cli.md) — the `trawl` CLI surface.
- [rendering.md](rendering.md) — how crawlers render human-readable output.
- [short-refs.md](short-refs.md) — the short-ref scheme for pointing at records.
- [observability.md](observability.md) — logs, run history and `doctor`.

## Query features

- [who.md](who.md) — people as a first-class query dimension.
- [relationship-context.md](relationship-context.md) — relationship inference, a design direction.
- [golden-path.md](golden-path.md) — the per-crawler quality bar.

## Platform and process

- [tcc.md](tcc.md) — the macOS permissions (TCC) strategy.
- [sync.md](sync.md) — syncing crawler directories with their upstreams.
- [style.md](style.md) — the writing style for every doc and output.
