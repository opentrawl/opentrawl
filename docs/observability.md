# Observability

Goal, in the owner's words: someone who has the code and a running
service — without being skilled in the code or in steering an agent —
can figure out what the hell is going on from the logs, and can run
one command that dispatches an error report with enough context that a
maintainer is not flying blind. Agents own the entire dev lifecycle
and operating loop without human intervention; the logs must be good
enough to support that. The software ideal is crash-only: it works or
it fails clearly. Nothing here to diagnose by tweaking.

Prior art for the report bundle: how Codex and Claude package session
context for debugging — inspiration, not a copy, and not distributed
tracing; this is one machine.

## What every crawler gets from trawlkit

One plain text log per crawler, and exactly one line grammar for
every line, with no exceptions:

    <timestamp> <level> <run-id> <command> <event>: <message>

    2026-07-02 22:41:03 INFO  019f23a1 sync start: gogcrawl 0.4.1+8f3c2d on macos 15
    2026-07-02 22:41:07 ERROR 019f23a1 sync gog_backup_failed: backup fetch exited early

One grammar because exactly one thing writes it: trawlkit's logging
helper. Crawlers cannot emit a differently shaped line, because the
only way to log is through the helper — the format is enforced by
construction, not by convention. Writes are single-line atomic
appends.

The log is self-documenting: the first line of every log file states
the grammar, so an agent or a person who opens one cold learns the
format from the file itself. The same grammar lives in the operator
section of the docs.

Plain lines because a person under stress reads them raw with tail
and grep; no JSON wrapper to see through. The stable shape is still
machine-parseable for trawl and agents.

Enrichment follows the canonical-log-line practice (Stripe popularised
it): context that never changes within a run — version, commit,
platform — lands once, on the run's start line, keyed by the run id
every later line carries. Lines stay lean; nothing is repeated onto
every line, and nothing needs a lookup outside the log itself.
Concurrent or interleaved runs cannot confuse a reader: every line
carries its run id, so filtering one run out of an interleaved log is
one grep.

A logged remedy is an admission of unfinished design: software prints
one only when the fix genuinely needs the world to change — grant a
permission, renew auth, run a costly sync. Anything software can fix
safely, it fixes and logs what it did (the self-healing rule in the
contract). This holds repo-wide, not just here; it is recorded in the
vision's engineering principles.

Every command logs — not just sync. Start, outcome, and every error,
across the whole operating loop: discovery, auth, sync, reads,
doctor. A failure that never reached a log line is a bug.

Bounded: fixed-size rotation per crawler, a few MB, oldest lines
dropped. No settings for path, size, level or retention. Levels are
info, warn, error; debug is a runtime switch (the app's debug mode, a
dev shell), never persisted config.

Sync must feel alive: first progress line immediately, then steady
heartbeats; a long opaque stage (a backup fetch) heartbeats with
elapsed time. Progress goes to stderr live and to the log.

## The operator surface

No new commands. `trawl status <source>` and `trawl doctor` read the
recent log tail: last run, outcome, most recent error. Operating the
suite starts and usually ends there.

Doctor's scope shrinks to match the self-healing principle: it checks
only the preconditions software cannot create for itself —
permissions, auth, the source store existing, a sync being needed.
Everything else either works or fails visibly in the log. Doctor is a
precondition checklist, not a debugger; the moment a doctor check's
fix could be automated safely, that check must disappear.

The dispatchable error report is prepared for, not built: because log
lines are content-safe by construction (never bodies, subjects,
contacts or secrets) and status and doctor already expose versions
and outcomes, a future report bundle is an afternoon of assembly the
day real pain justifies it — not a design problem, and not a verb
today. The same holds one step further out: sentry without sentry —
recurring errors grouped across runs into one local view. The line
shape (stable event codes, run ids) is chosen so that becomes a
reader over existing logs when its day comes, never a new system.

## Out of scope, deliberately

Metrics, SLOs, dashboards, remote telemetry, tracing infrastructure.
One machine, local first. The horse is: every failure lands in a
readable log, healed if software could heal it, and the evidence is
one read away.

## Conformance

- every command logs start and outcome; every error logs with remedy
- sync emits progress immediately and heartbeats through long stages
- log lines match the stable shape and never contain content or secrets
- rotation holds the size bound
- status and doctor surface the most recent error and remedy
