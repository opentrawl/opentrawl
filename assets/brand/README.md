# OpenTrawl brand assets

The mark: a red faceted diamond drawn as a network — nodes and edges form the
gem, a faint context graph wraps the frame. The network trawls; the diamond is
the catch.

Palette (matches the website): red #e63323, black #101010, white, greys.
No gold, no other colours in the mark.

## Brand guidelines

Which asset where:

- app icon (macOS 26+): `OpenTrawl.icon`, compiled to Assets.car at build time
- app icon (pre-Tahoe): `exports/icns/OpenTrawl.icns`
- menu bar: `exports/menubar/template-*.png` (or `src/glyph-menubar.svg`)
- website: `exports/web/` — favicons, touch icon, `mark.svg`, lockups
- link previews: `exports/social/card.png` — 1200x630, built by
  `build/build_card.py`, which takes its words from `website/copy.txt` and
  writes a copy to `website/card.png`. Rebuild it after editing the hero copy.
- social: `exports/social/` — X banner 1500x500, avatar (400 for upload);
  `avatar-glass.jpg` (1024, white background) is the system-rendered Liquid
  Glass tile for GitHub and anywhere else that wants the "real app icon" look
- disk image: `exports/dmg/background.png` — the branded drag-to-Applications
  Finder background, generated from `src/dmg-background.svg`
- video and print: `src/lockup.svg` (light or dark ink), or `src/mark.svg` alone

Rules, learned the hard way — do not relitigate without a strong reason:

- the gem's seams and node rings are always #101010, on every background;
  never swap them to white on dark
- the icon background does not change in dark mode (light tile pinned)
- below 128px, always use `mark-small.svg`: no wrap, thicker seams, vertex
  nodes only; the full mark's detail turns to mud at small sizes
- the faint wrap never touches the gem's nodes — spokes stop short, the
  outer ring breaks around the extreme vertices
- gem cells use exactly the three reds (#ef5a48, #e63323, #c22417 plus
  #f2634f on the crown corners); nodes stay red — no multicolour nodes
- no gold, no gradients in the artwork, no baked shadows or gloss (the
  system renders glass), no outlines around the gem, no photorealism
- menu bar glyph is black + alpha only; the seam cuts are transparent,
  not white
- avatars for social are opaque white, not transparent (platforms
  recompress and composite unpredictably)
- wordmark: lowercase Helvetica bold, "open" in ink, "trawl" in red

## Layout

- `src/` — canonical vector sources. `mark.svg` is the full mark, `mark-small.svg`
  the simplified variant used below 128px (thicker seams, vertex nodes only,
  no wrap), `glyph-menubar.svg` the mono menu bar glyph, `lockup.svg` the mark
  plus wordmark. Two colour tokens are replaced at build time: `#FNT` (faint
  wrap: `#c9c9c9` on light, `#48484a` on dark) and `#INK` (text/glyph ink).
  The gem's own seams are always literal `#101010`, never theme-swapped.
- `OpenTrawl.icon/` — hand-authored Icon Composer bundle (icon.json + layers).
  The system renders Liquid Glass from it; the artwork carries no baked
  effects. `fill-specializations` pins the light background for dark mode:
  the icon does not change colour in dark mode.
- `build/` — python scripts that regenerate `exports/` from `src/` (headless
  Chrome for rendering, `iconutil` for the icns). Run from inside `build/`.
- `exports/` — committed build outputs: legacy `OpenTrawl.icns` (light tile,
  full ladder), (compile `Assets.car` for macOS 26+ from `OpenTrawl.icon` — see below; it is not committed because it is a >1MB reproducible binary), menu bar template PNGs
  (16/18pt + @2x, black + alpha only), and the web set (favicons, touch icon,
  mark, lockups).

## The Apple pipeline (no GUI needed)

Compile the .icon bundle:

    DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode-beta.app xcrun actool \
      --output-format human-readable-text --notices --warnings \
      --platform macosx --minimum-deployment-target 15.0 \
      --app-icon OpenTrawl --output-partial-info-plist partial.plist \
      --compile out OpenTrawl.icon

Preview any appearance (Default, Dark, TintedLight, TintedDark, ClearLight,
ClearDark):

    "/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Applications/Icon Composer.app/Contents/Executables/ictool" \
      OpenTrawl.icon --export-image --output-file out.png \
      --platform macOS --rendition Default --width 512 --height 512 --scale 1

Known caveat: ictool previews ignore `fill-specializations`, so its Dark
export shows an auto-darkened tile. The real system renderer reads the pin
from the compiled Assets.car. Verify in a live dock once the Mac app ships
the icon.

Regenerate `exports/social/avatar-glass.jpg` (the glass tile as a flat image):
export the Default rendition with ictool at 1024, composite onto white
(headless Chrome over a plain white page works), convert to JPEG with
`sips -s format jpeg -s formatOptions 92`. The transparent ictool PNG is
not committed (over the repo's 1MB binary limit).

Ship in an app bundle: `Assets.car` into `Contents/Resources`, set
`CFBundleIconName` to `OpenTrawl`, keep `OpenTrawl.icns` alongside with
`CFBundleIconFile` for pre-Tahoe macOS, sign last.

Menu bar: load a template PNG pair (or the glyph SVG) with
`NSImage.isTemplate = true`; artwork is black + alpha only and the system
tints it per appearance.

## Other companies' app icons

`app-icons/` holds the icons of the apps OpenTrawl searches, used to show what
it works with. They belong to Apple, Meta, Telegram and Google. Seven come from
the app bundles on a Mac; Gmail and X come from the App Store artwork the Mac
app already fetches at runtime. They are not OpenTrawl brand assets and none of
the rules above apply to them.

## Icons for sources without an app

A source with no Mac app of its own, such as Money, has an Icon Composer icon
in `source-icons/`. The build compiles it into the app's `Assets.car` beside
the app icon (`actool --alternate-app-icon <name>`), and the app loads it by
the name in the source's branding (`icon_name_in_mac_app_asset_catalog`). The
system renders its glass, so it matches the real app icons it sits beside.

Draw these to match those neighbours, not the OpenTrawl mark: a light tile
like Notes and Calendar, one bold shape at Apple's content margins, glyphs as
filled outlines (the glass renderer closes open stroked paths), and every
detail still readable at 36 px on a 1x screen. Check with ictool in every
rendition, and in the app at the sizes it really uses.
