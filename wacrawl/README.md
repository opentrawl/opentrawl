# 🧾 wacrawl

WhatsApp archaeology with encrypted receipts.

Read-only local archive and search for the macOS WhatsApp Desktop app.

`wacrawl` copies WhatsApp Desktop's local SQLite databases into a temporary
snapshot, imports the useful chat data into its own SQLite archive, and gives
you scriptable commands for status, chat listing, message listing, and full-text
search.

It is for local inspection. It does not send messages, decrypt backups, talk to
WhatsApp Web, or write back into WhatsApp's app container.

## Install

Build `trawl` from the monorepo root:

```bash
scripts/dev-bin
```

## Quick Start

First, check whether `wacrawl` can see the local WhatsApp Desktop data:

```bash
trawl wacrawl doctor
```

Sync a fresh local archive:

```bash
trawl wacrawl sync
```

Inspect what was imported:

```bash
trawl wacrawl status
trawl wacrawl chats --limit 20
trawl wacrawl unread --limit 20
trawl wacrawl messages --limit 20
```

Search message text:

```bash
trawl wacrawl search "release notes"
```

Use JSON for scripts:

```bash
trawl --json wacrawl search "invoice" --from-them --after 2026-01-01
```

## What It Reads

On macOS, WhatsApp Desktop stores app data in:

```text
~/Library/Group Containers/group.net.whatsapp.WhatsApp.shared
```

`wacrawl` currently imports from:

```text
ChatStorage.sqlite
ContactsV2.sqlite
Message/Media/
```

It writes its own archive to:

```text
~/.opentrawl/wacrawl/wacrawl.db
```

Set the WhatsApp source path in `~/.opentrawl/wacrawl/config.toml`:

```toml
source = "~/Library/Group Containers/group.net.whatsapp.WhatsApp.shared"
```

Use a temporary `HOME` when you want a separate test archive.

## Safety

- Opens WhatsApp data read-only.
- Copies SQLite database, WAL, and SHM files into a temp snapshot before import.
- Replaces only the `wacrawl` archive database.
- Does not modify WhatsApp databases, settings, contacts, chats, or media.
- Does not use the WhatsApp network protocol.
- Does not upload data during normal archive/search commands. `backup push`
  uploads only age-encrypted backup shards when you explicitly run it.

The archive can contain private message data. Keep `~/.opentrawl/wacrawl/wacrawl.db`
local and out of commits, backups, and shared logs unless that is intentional.

## Commands

### `doctor`

Inspect the source path and database shape:

```bash
trawl wacrawl doctor
trawl --json wacrawl doctor
```

Reports source availability, discovered database files, row counts, message date
range, and importer schema notes.

### `sync`

Snapshot WhatsApp Desktop data and replace the local archive in one transaction:

```bash
trawl wacrawl sync
```

Imports:

- chats
- contacts
- groups
- group participants
- messages
- media metadata and local media paths

By default, media paths continue to point at WhatsApp Desktop's app container.
Set `copy_media = true` in `~/.opentrawl/wacrawl/config.toml` to copy
referenced media files into `media/` next to the archive database and rewrite
copied message media paths to that archive copy.
Missing media files are counted in the import output and do not fail the import.

### `status`

Show archive counts and metadata:

```bash
trawl wacrawl status
```

Includes message, media-message, chat, unread-chat, unread-message, contact,
group, participant, source, and timestamp fields when they are available.

`status` reads the existing archive. Run `trawl wacrawl sync` when you want to
refresh from WhatsApp Desktop.

### `chats`

List chats ordered by newest message:

```bash
trawl wacrawl chats
trawl wacrawl chats --limit 100
trawl wacrawl chats --unread
```

Unread state comes from WhatsApp Desktop's per-chat unread counter. Message
rows do not expose a reliable incoming per-message "read by me" flag.

### `unread`

List only chats with unread messages:

```bash
trawl wacrawl unread
trawl wacrawl unread --limit 100
```

### `messages`

List archived messages:

```bash
trawl wacrawl messages
trawl wacrawl messages --chat 1234567890@s.whatsapp.net
trawl wacrawl messages --after 2026-01-01 --from-them
trawl wacrawl messages --has-media --json
```

Filters:

```text
--chat JID       Restrict to one chat.
--sender JID     Restrict to one sender.
--limit N        Max rows. Default: 50.
--after DATE     RFC3339 timestamp or YYYY-MM-DD.
--before DATE    RFC3339 timestamp or YYYY-MM-DD.
--from-me        Only outgoing messages.
--from-them      Only incoming messages.
--has-media      Only messages with media metadata.
--asc            Oldest first.
```

### `search`

Search the archive with SQLite FTS5:

```bash
trawl wacrawl search "launch"
trawl wacrawl search "invoice" --after 2026-01-01 --who "Alice Example"
trawl --json wacrawl search "restaurant"
```

Search uses message text, chat name, sender name, and media title fields. It
accepts `--limit`, `--all`, `--after`, `--before`, and `--who`.

## Sync Behavior

`wacrawl` syncs only when you ask it to sync. Read commands such as `status`,
`chats`, `messages`, and `search` inspect the existing archive without touching
the WhatsApp Desktop source or changing local state.

Examples:

```bash
trawl wacrawl sync
trawl wacrawl status
trawl --json wacrawl messages --limit 10
```

## Encrypted Git Backup

`wacrawl` can back up the archive to a Git repository using age-encrypted JSONL
shards. This is meant for a private repository such as
`https://github.com/steipete/backup-wacrawl`, but the message data is encrypted
before Git sees it.

The backup repo contains:

```text
README.md
manifest.json
data/chats.jsonl.gz.age
data/contacts.jsonl.gz.age
data/groups.jsonl.gz.age
data/group_participants.jsonl.gz.age
data/messages/YYYY/MM.jsonl.gz.age
data/files/index*.jsonl.gz.age
data/files/objects/OPAQUE_ID.gz.age
```

`manifest.json` is intentionally cleartext so a machine can inspect backup
freshness, public age recipients, counts, shard paths, encrypted byte sizes, and
plaintext hashes without decrypting backup contents. It does not contain
message text, chat names, contacts, participant IDs, media metadata, filenames,
or archive paths. Those fields live inside the `*.jsonl.gz.age` shards.

Media previously copied with `copy_media = true` is included by default.
Identical files share one encrypted blob with a random opaque object ID. Their
content hashes remain inside the encrypted index. Use `backup push --no-media`
or `backup pull --no-media` when only archive rows are wanted.

### Command Cheat Sheet

Use these most of the time:

```bash
# First-time setup on a machine.
trawl wacrawl backup init \
  --repo ~/Projects/backup-wacrawl \
  --remote https://github.com/steipete/backup-wacrawl.git

# Refresh WhatsApp data if needed, encrypt, commit, and push to GitHub.
trawl wacrawl backup push

# Pull the Git backup, decrypt, verify, and import into the local archive.
trawl wacrawl backup pull

# List restorable commits and any snapshot tags.
trawl wacrawl backup snapshots

# Inspect the backup manifest without decrypting message data.
trawl wacrawl backup status
```

Useful safety variants:

```bash
# Force a fresh WhatsApp sync before writing the backup.
trawl wacrawl sync
trawl wacrawl backup push

# Write and commit locally, but do not push to GitHub.
trawl wacrawl backup push --no-push

# Create a named checkpoint while pushing a backup.
trawl wacrawl backup push --tag snapshot/before-phone-migration

# Restore into a temporary home for testing.
backup_repo="$HOME/Projects/backup-wacrawl"
backup_identity="$HOME/.opentrawl/wacrawl/age.key"
test_home="$(mktemp -d)"
HOME="$test_home" trawl wacrawl backup pull --repo "$backup_repo" --identity "$backup_identity"
HOME="$test_home" trawl wacrawl status

# Restore a historical tag, commit, or branch without changing the backup checkout.
trawl wacrawl backup pull --ref snapshot/before-phone-migration
```

You should not need to run `git` manually for normal use. `backup push` handles
the backup repo fetch/rebase, commit, and push. A normal `backup pull` syncs the
current archive branch; `backup pull --ref` fetches refs and reads the requested
Git objects without switching or rewriting the backup checkout.

Every changed backup is already a Git commit. Use `--tag NAME` to add an
optional named checkpoint without moving an existing tag. Tag names and commit
metadata are visible to anyone who can inspect the Git repository, so keep tag
names non-sensitive. `backup snapshots` lists the newest manifest-changing
commits and their tags; use `--limit N` to control the history depth.

### Encryption and Security Model

Backups use the Go `filippo.io/age` library with X25519 age identities. There
is no backup password. Each machine has an age identity file, usually:

```text
~/.opentrawl/wacrawl/age.key
```

That file contains an `AGE-SECRET-KEY-...` private identity and is written with
0600 permissions. Its matching public recipient starts with `age1...` and is
safe to place in `~/.opentrawl/wacrawl/config.toml`, `manifest.json`, or docs.

For each shard, `trawl wacrawl backup push`:

1. Exports rows from the local archive as deterministic JSONL.
2. Streams copied media through hashing, gzip, and age encryption in one pass.
3. Content-deduplicates identical media and encrypts the private path index.
4. Encrypts every compressed payload for each configured recipient.
5. Writes only encrypted `*.jsonl.gz.age` payloads to Git.
6. Writes `manifest.json` with cleartext metadata used for status, diffing, and restore verification.

`trawl wacrawl backup pull` does the reverse: it pulls/rebases the backup repo,
checks manifest shard paths, decrypts each shard with the local age identity,
verifies row and media hashes, restores copied media under `media/` next to the
configured database, localizes portable media paths, validates cross-table
references, and imports the snapshot in one transaction.

What the backup protects:

- A GitHub read-only compromise or accidental clone does not reveal message text,
  contacts, chat names, participant IDs, media metadata, filenames, or archive paths.
- Each encrypted shard can be decrypted by any listed age recipient, so multiple
  machines can share one backup without sharing one private key.
- Age provides encrypted-file integrity; corrupted or wrong-key shards fail to
  decrypt, and `wacrawl` also checks manifest hashes after decrypting.

What remains visible in Git:

- `manifest.json` is cleartext.
- The manifest reveals export time, public recipients, table names, row counts,
  opaque shard paths, encrypted byte sizes, row/index hashes, and media counts.
  Individual media paths, filenames, plaintext sizes, and content hashes remain encrypted.
- Message shard paths reveal activity by year and month, for example
  `data/messages/2026/04.jsonl.gz.age`.
- Git history reveals backup cadence and which encrypted shards changed.

Important limits:

- This is not end-to-end provenance. Someone who can push to the backup repo can
  replace the backup with different data encrypted to your public recipient.
  Use normal GitHub access control and review unexpected backup commits.
- If `~/.opentrawl/wacrawl/age.key` is lost and no other configured recipient exists, the
  encrypted backup cannot be restored.
- If an age identity is compromised, remove its public recipient, run
  `trawl wacrawl backup push` to re-encrypt current shards, and consider rewriting or
  deleting old Git history because older commits may still be decryptable with
  the compromised key.
- X25519 age recipients are not post-quantum. They are a practical modern
  default, but not a post-quantum archival guarantee.
- The local archive database `~/.opentrawl/wacrawl/wacrawl.db` and the WhatsApp Desktop
  source data remain plaintext on the machine. Protect the machine and local
  backups accordingly.

### Initial Setup

Initialize the backup repository and local age identity:

```bash
trawl wacrawl backup init \
  --repo ~/Projects/backup-wacrawl \
  --remote https://github.com/steipete/backup-wacrawl.git
```

This writes the `[backup]` table in `~/.opentrawl/wacrawl/config.toml`, creates `~/.opentrawl/wacrawl/age.key` if needed,
clones or initializes the local backup checkout, and prints the public age
recipient.

The generated config looks like this:

```toml
[backup]
repo = "~/Projects/backup-wacrawl"
remote = "https://github.com/steipete/backup-wacrawl.git"
identity = "~/.opentrawl/wacrawl/age.key"
recipients = ["age1..."]
```

Keep `~/.opentrawl/wacrawl/age.key` private. The public `age1...` recipient can be stored
in `config.toml`; the `AGE-SECRET-KEY-...` identity must stay local or in a
password manager.

### Push

Push an encrypted backup:

```bash
trawl wacrawl backup push
```

`backup push` first pulls/rebases the configured backup checkout, then exports
the current local archive. Run `trawl wacrawl sync` before `backup push` when you
want to include the latest WhatsApp Desktop data. It exports stable JSONL,
gzip-compresses each
shard, encrypts each shard for every configured recipient, updates
`manifest.json`, removes stale encrypted shards, commits, and pushes the backup
repo. Copied files already under the archive `media/` directory are included by
default; set `copy_media = true` and run `trawl wacrawl sync` first to capture media
bytes still available from WhatsApp Desktop. `backup push` never reads media
directly from the WhatsApp container.

Pass `--tag NAME` to tag the resulting snapshot commit. If the archive is
unchanged, the tag points at the existing current snapshot. Existing tags are
never moved to a different commit.

Re-running `backup push` without archive changes leaves Git clean. The command
prints the repo path, whether anything changed, whether the backup is encrypted,
the shard count, message count, and copied-media count.

Use `--no-push` for local dry runs that commit into the backup checkout but do
not push to the remote:

```bash
trawl wacrawl backup push --no-push
```

Use `--no-media` to omit copied media from a snapshot. The current backup then
contains archive rows only; earlier Git commits still retain their media blobs.

### Restore

Restore from the backup repo:

```bash
trawl wacrawl backup pull
```

`backup pull` pulls/rebases the configured backup repo, decrypts every shard with
the local age identity, verifies each plaintext shard hash from the manifest,
validates cross-table references, and replaces the configured `wacrawl` archive
database in one import transaction. Copied media is restored alongside the
database unless `--no-media` is set.

Restore a historical tag, commit, or branch with `--ref`:

```bash
trawl wacrawl backup pull --ref snapshot/before-phone-migration
```

Historical restore resolves the ref to a commit and reads its manifest and
encrypted shards directly from Git objects. It does not checkout that commit or
change the backup repository's current branch.

To test a restore without touching your real archive:

```bash
backup_repo="$HOME/Projects/backup-wacrawl"
backup_identity="$HOME/.opentrawl/wacrawl/age.key"
test_home="$(mktemp -d)"
HOME="$test_home" trawl wacrawl backup pull --repo "$backup_repo" --identity "$backup_identity"
HOME="$test_home" trawl wacrawl status
```

### Status

Inspect backup metadata:

```bash
trawl wacrawl backup status
```

This reports encryption status, shard count, message count, export timestamp,
and repo path. It reads `manifest.json`; it does not need to decrypt shards.

### Multiple Machines

Each machine that should restore needs its own age identity. On the new machine:

```bash
trawl wacrawl backup init \
  --repo ~/Projects/backup-wacrawl \
  --remote https://github.com/steipete/backup-wacrawl.git
```

Copy the printed public recipient (`age1...`) into `backup.recipients` in
`~/.opentrawl/wacrawl/config.toml` on a machine that can already decrypt the backup, then
run:

```bash
trawl wacrawl backup push
```

After that push, newly written shards are encrypted for all configured
recipients. If you added a recipient after data already existed, run a normal
`trawl wacrawl backup push`; unchanged plaintext shards are re-encrypted when the
manifest/config changes.

For personal setup, storing a copy of `~/.opentrawl/wacrawl/age.key` in 1Password is a
good recovery path. Do not commit the identity file. Do not paste the
`AGE-SECRET-KEY-...` value into issues, logs, docs, or chat.

### Flags

Useful flags:

```text
--repo PATH          Local backup Git checkout.
--remote URL         Backup Git remote.
--identity PATH      Local age identity. Default: ~/.opentrawl/wacrawl/age.key
--recipient AGE      Public age recipient. Repeat for multiple machines.
--no-push            Commit locally but do not push.
```

### Recovery Checklist

On a new Mac:

```bash
scripts/dev-bin   # from the monorepo checkout
git clone https://github.com/steipete/backup-wacrawl.git ~/Projects/backup-wacrawl
mkdir -p ~/.opentrawl/wacrawl
```

Then restore `~/.opentrawl/wacrawl/age.key` from your password manager and create
`~/.opentrawl/wacrawl/config.toml` pointing at the clone:

```toml
[backup]
repo = "~/Projects/backup-wacrawl"
remote = "https://github.com/steipete/backup-wacrawl.git"
identity = "~/.opentrawl/wacrawl/age.key"
recipients = ["age1..."]
```

Finally:

```bash
trawl wacrawl backup pull
trawl wacrawl status
```

If decryption fails, the local `identity` does not match any recipient used for
the encrypted shards. If Git push fails, fix normal GitHub permissions for the
backup repository; the archive data is already encrypted before the push.

## Global Flags

```text
--json             Emit JSON instead of human-readable output.
-v, --verbose      Stream log lines to stderr.
-vv                Stream debug log lines to stderr.
--version          Print the CLI version.
```

## Data Format Notes

WhatsApp Desktop uses CoreData-style SQLite tables. The importer currently knows
about:

```text
ZWACHATSESSION
ZWAMESSAGE
ZWAMEDIAITEM
ZWAGROUPINFO
ZWAGROUPMEMBER
```

Important details:

- WhatsApp timestamps are seconds since `2001-01-01T00:00:00Z`.
- `ZWAMESSAGE.Z_PK` is used as the source row identity.
- `ZSTANZAID` is not unique enough for archive identity.
- Group senders are resolved through `ZWAMESSAGE.ZGROUPMEMBER`.
- Media is joined through both `ZWAMESSAGE.ZMEDIAITEM` and
  `ZWAMEDIAITEM.ZMESSAGE`.
- WhatsApp's own search database uses a custom `wa_tokenizer`; `wacrawl` builds
  a portable FTS5 index instead.

## Development

Requires Go 1.26 or newer.

```bash
go test ./...
```

Regenerate sqlc wrappers after changing `internal/store/sqlc/`:
