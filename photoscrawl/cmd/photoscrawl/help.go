Control manifest for trawl discovery: capabilities, commands, privacy.`,

Archive freshness, asset counts, and the last run's log tail.`,
	"doctor": `Usage: photoscrawl doctor [--json] [--db <path>] [--library <path>]

Source access and archive health checks.`,
	"sync": `Usage: photoscrawl sync [--library <path>] [--json] [--db <path>]

Import the Apple Photos library into the archive. Safe to re-run;
only new and changed assets are written.`,
	"classify": `Usage: photoscrawl classify [--model <id>] [--limit <n>] [--all] [--json] [--db <path>]

Write metadata, place, and model-card observations for queued assets.
Without --model only mechanical metadata is classified.
--limit bounds a run (default 100); --all classifies every queued asset.`,
	"search": `Usage: photoscrawl search <query> [--after <date>] [--before <date>] [--limit <n>] [--all] [--json] [--db <path>]

Full-text search over photo cards, filenames, albums, and places.
Terms are stemmed and OR-combined; results are ranked, best first.
Dates take 2006-01-02 or RFC 3339 forms.
--limit is honored exactly (default 20); --all returns every match.`,
	"open": `Usage: photoscrawl open <ref> [--json] [--db <path>]

Full card for one asset: capture facts, place, summary, description.
Accepts the canonical photoscrawl:asset/<32-hex> ref or a short alias
from search output.`,
