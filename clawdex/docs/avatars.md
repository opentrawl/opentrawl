# Avatars

Every person can carry a single avatar image, stored as a real file next to
their `person.md`. Avatars are deliberately first-class — they are how
exported vCards stay recognizable in Apple Contacts, Google Contacts, and
phone dial screens.

On disk:

```text
people/sally-o-malley/
  person.md
  avatars/
    avatar.jpg          # or .png
```

The `person.md` frontmatter records the avatar's MIME type, sha256, source
(`manual`, `apple`, `google`), and updated time. The bytes are kept on disk;
the markdown only points at them.

## Set a manual avatar

```bash
clawdex person avatar set sally ~/Pictures/sally.jpg
clawdex person avatar set sally ~/Pictures/sally.png --dry-run
```

`--dry-run` inspects the source image (MIME, SHA256) and previews the
avatar metadata that would be written, without touching the data repo.

Manual avatars are sticky: subsequent `clawdex import apple` and
`clawdex import google` runs will **never overwrite a manual avatar**. To
let imports manage the avatar again, clear it first.

## Show

```bash
clawdex person avatar show sally
clawdex person avatar show sally --path
clawdex person avatar show sally --json
```

`--path` prints the absolute path to the avatar file and nothing else, so
you can pipe it into a viewer:

```bash
open "$(clawdex person avatar show sally --path)"
```

## Clear

```bash
clawdex person avatar clear sally
```

Clears the avatar metadata from `person.md`. The file under `avatars/` is
left alone in case you want to recover it; remove it manually if you're
sure.

## Avatars from imports

Avatars are opt-in on imports — the `--avatars` flag is required:

```bash
clawdex import apple  --avatars
clawdex import google --account you@gmail.com --avatars
```

- **Apple.** Reads thumbnail bytes from the local AddressBook database.
  macOS-only, with the same Full Disk Access requirement as `import apple`.
- **Google.** Calls `gog contacts raw --person-fields photos`, picks the
  selected photo URL, fetches the bytes through
  [`gog`](https://github.com/steipete/gogcli), and stores them locally.
  Only metadata (URL, MIME, SHA256) is written into `person.md`.

In both cases the bytes live on your machine. Clawdex never silently
re-fetches them on later runs.

## vCard export

Avatars are embedded into vCards as base64 `PHOTO;ENCODING=b` payloads when
you opt in:

```bash
clawdex export vcard --all --include-avatars -o contacts.vcf
```

Without `--include-avatars`, the export is text-only — handy when you want a
small file or are emailing the vCard to someone.
