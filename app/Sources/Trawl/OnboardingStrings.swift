      \(buildDescription)
      \(source)

      OpenTrawl says that its production beta:
      - reads local data from Messages, WhatsApp, Telegram, Notes and Contacts;
      - writes separate search archives under ~/.opentrawl;
      - keeps those archives and my searches on my Mac;
      - has no telemetry or analytics;
      - does not run servers that receive my archive, searches or usage data;
      - keeps source syncing on my Mac by default. The app checks GitHub for updates. If I ask OpenTrawl to download missing Telegram media, it requests that media from Telegram.

      \(auditTarget) Explain in plain English what OpenTrawl reads, what leaves my Mac, which network requests happen automatically or when I ask for them, whether OpenTrawl receives any of my personal data, and whether the app has telemetry or analytics.

      When deciding whether the production beta matches these claims, ignore disabled or feature-flagged pre-release features, tests, debug tools, unfinished work, future code and standalone crawler commands the beta does not offer. If any of that is worth mentioning, put it in a separate section called "Not part of the production beta".

      If you can inspect the installed app, check that its GitCommit is \(identity.gitCommit)\(identity.hasLocalChanges ? " and note that this local build includes uncommitted changes" : ""). If you cannot check the installed app, continue with the source review and simply say that the installed build was not independently checked. Do not treat that alone as a privacy problem.

      Finish by telling me whether OpenTrawl's privacy claims are accurate and whether giving this build Full Disk Access is reasonable. Do not access my personal data or change anything.
