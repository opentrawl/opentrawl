# 🧱 crawlkit

![crawlkit banner](docs/assets/readme-banner.jpg)

Shared Go infrastructure for local-first crawler archives.

`crawlkit` is not a universal Slack, Discord, Notion, or GitHub crawler. It is
the reusable foundation beneath those tools: SQLite hygiene, TOML config
defaults, portable JSONL/Gzip packing, git-backed snapshot sharing, sync state,
CLI output helpers, control/status metadata, a shared terminal explorer, and
safe desktop-cache snapshot utilities.

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/openclaw/crawlkit@latest
go install github.com/openclaw/crawlkit/cmd/crawlctl@latest
```

Go packages are published by tagging this repository. There is no separate
package registry step. See `docs/publishing.md` for the release commands.
See `docs/boundary.md` for the crawlkit-versus-app ownership boundary and
`docs/remote-contract.md` for the Worker/client split.

## Packages

- `config`: standard TOML config paths, opt-in platform-native runtime dirs,
  migration-safe legacy path fallback, and token diagnostics.
- `store`: SQLite open/read-only/transaction/query helpers plus safe FTS5 term and optimization helpers.
- `snapshot`: `manifest.json` plus JSONL/Gzip table snapshot export, file fingerprints, exact or monotonic-merge import planning, impact classification, and managed sidecar trees.
- `backup`: age-encrypted JSONL/Gzip shards, backup manifests, recipient/identity helpers, history listing, and historical-ref restore verification.
- `mirror`: clone/init/pull/commit/push helpers plus non-mutating fetch, immutable tags, Git-object reads, and history inspection for private snapshot repos.
- `state`: generic crawler cursor and freshness records, including mapped adapters for existing app table layouts.
- `embed`: reusable OpenAI-compatible, Ollama, and llama.cpp embedding providers plus local probe diagnostics.
- `vector`: float32 vector encoding, dimension validation, exact cosine search, optional turbovec-backed search for dimensions divisible by 8 up to 8,192, top-k helpers, and reciprocal-rank fusion.
- `releasecheck`: GitHub release checks, 24-hour cache handling, scripted-output
  suppression, and stderr update notice formatting for crawl app CLIs.
- `remote`: provider-neutral HTTP client, config, query, ingest, auth, status,
  and protocol contract metadata for Worker-fronted remote archives such as
  Cloudflare D1.
- `output`: text/json/log output helpers.
- `control`: crawl app metadata, command manifests, status payloads, contact-export contracts, and database inventory for launchers and automation.
- `scheduler`: crawl app discovery, job config, single-process run locking,
  JSONL run history, log paths, and launchd/systemd/Windows/cron schedule
  rendering for controller CLIs.
- `tui`: shared terminal archive explorer with gitcrawl-style responsive panes, entity/member/detail lanes, compact sortable headers, mouse selection, floating right-click actions, sorting/filtering, and local/remote source status.
- `cache`: safe read-only local cache and SQLite DB/WAL/SHM snapshot helpers.

## crawlctl

`crawlctl` is the shared controller for keeping local crawl archives warm.
It discovers installed crawl apps through `metadata --json`, falls back to
temporary legacy adapters for older apps, runs configured jobs with a lock, and
records one JSONL run record per command.

```bash
crawlctl init --repo openclaw/openclaw
crawlctl run
crawlctl status
crawlctl logs gitcrawl --tail 80
crawlctl install --dry-run
```

Native install backends:

- macOS: `launchd`
- Linux: `systemd --user`
- Windows: Task Scheduler
- portable fallback: cron line rendering

## Downstream apps

- `gitcrawl`, `discrawl`, `notcrawl`, `wacrawl`, `telecrawl`, and `slacrawl`
  consume `crawlkit` on `main`.
- The apps keep provider schemas, auth, desktop/API parsing, privacy filters,
  and user-facing CLI contracts. `crawlkit` owns only the reusable mechanics.

## Safety

Library tests use temporary directories. They do not touch app runtime stores
such as `~/.config/gitcrawl`, `~/.slacrawl`, `~/.discrawl`, or `~/.notcrawl`.
