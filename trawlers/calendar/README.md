# Calendar

The Calendar crawler snapshots the local Apple Calendar database and builds a
private SQLite archive of events, calendars, participants and source
provenance. It does not use EventKit, CalDAV, Google APIs or the network.

## Source and storage

The source is:

```text
~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.calendar/Calendar.sqlitedb
```

Sync copies the database and its SQLite sidecars to a temporary private
directory before reading them. The archive is
`~/.opentrawl/calendar/calendar.db`; logs are under
`~/.opentrawl/calendar/logs/`.

The crawler archives event calendars visible to Calendar.app, including iCloud,
Google, local and subscribed calendars. It excludes the Reminders store.

## Commands

```sh
trawl sync calendar
trawl calendar status
trawl calendar search "planning" --who "Alice Example"
trawl calendar search --who alice@example.com
trawl calendar who alice
trawl calendar open LINK
```

The CLI uses normal text output. Search covers event titles, descriptions,
locations and participant names or addresses. It accepts `--limit`, `--after`,
`--before` and `--who`; a filter-only search lists the newest matching events.

Human search output shows a stable `LINK` that `open` accepts without guessing.
Canonical provider record references remain internal typed and storage values.
`open` returns one bounded event with people, time, location, calendar and
recurrence state.

During sync, Calendar contributes participants with a display name and phone
number to the shared People index. Participant email addresses remain
searchable even when they cannot identify a person there.

## Limits and privacy

Recurrence rules are not expanded into a separate series explanation. The
archive stores the event rows and recurrence flag exposed by Calendar.

All reads and writes are local. Read commands do not refresh the archive or
change Calendar. Public examples and tests use synthetic events and temporary
databases.
