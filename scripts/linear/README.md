# Linear CLI

`linear` posts to Linear as an OAuth app actor. Write commands require
`--as`, so every agent-created issue or comment carries an explicit
display name instead of posting as the human OAuth user. Linear state
changes carry no display name, so `issue state` records the actor in
the request log instead.

## Build

Run this from `scripts/linear`:

```sh
go build -o linear .
```

The repo MCP config runs `scripts/linear/linear mcp`, so rebuild the
binary after changing this module.

## Configure

Set the OAuth app credentials in the environment:

```sh
export LINEAR_CLIENT_ID=...
export LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

The CLI caches the app token at `~/.opentrawl/linear/token.json` with
file mode `0600`.

## Use

```sh
linear inbox --team TRAWL
linear ack 00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000000
linear comment TRAWL-99 --as coordinator "Ready for review."
linear issue new --team TRAWL --title "Fix sync output" --as reviewer --label agent-filed
linear issue state TRAWL-99 --state Done --as coordinator
linear issue TRAWL-99
linear issues --team TRAWL
linear mcp
```

## Directive queue

Josh leaves human-authored comments on Linear issues. Agents run
`linear inbox` to find comments from Josh that the app user has not
reacted to yet.

Convention is ack-then-act: run `linear ack <COMMENT-ID>` first, then
act on the directive. If the tool says `already acked`, another agent
owns that directive, so skip it.

The ack is an eyes reaction from the Linear app user. That reaction is
the queue state. There is no local inbox file.

The ack is not an atomic claim. If 2 agents ack within the same instant,
both can see `acked`: Linear treats duplicate reactions as success. The
tool pre-checks the comment's reactions, which catches every normal
case but not a simultaneous race. We accept that tradeoff.

Claimed-but-crashed work is visible to Josh: an eyes reaction with no
follow-up comment means re-ping.
